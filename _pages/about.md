# About me

Hey! Welcome to my home page! Here is Yi-ming Yuan, a Hakka Cantonese in China. I am currently a master student in [Wilson College of Textiles](https://textiles.ncsu.edu/), [North Carolina State University](https://www.ncsu.edu/) My major is Textile Engineering. 

I obtained my BSc in [School of Microelectronics]() (SME), Southern University of Science and Technology (SUSTech). My supervisor was Prof. [Min Wang](https://faculty.sustech.edu.cn/wangm/en), who is the director of Smart Sensor Lab (SSLab). My bachelor's thesis was ionotronic pressure sensor with high sensitivity. This project was with a collaboration with Prof. Canhui Yang, and that is why I joined Yang's Group as a research assistant after my graduation.

I spent 1.5 years in Yang's Group in [Department of Mechanics and Aerospace Engineering](https://mae.sustech.edu.cn/en/) (MAE), SUSTech. Prof. [Canhui Yang](https://faculty.sustech.edu.cn/yangch/en/) was my supervisor, who really helped me a lot. I really learnt many things from him. At that time, I focused on the ionotronic pressure sensor during the period. Finally we published a paper titled "[Microstructured Polyelectrolyte Elastomer-Based Ionotronic Sensors with High Sensitivities and Excellent Stability for Artificial Skins](https://doi.org/10.1002/adma.202310429)" on *Advanced Materials*. Working in Yang's Group is a fantastic experience.

After leaving SUSTech, I flew to the [North Carolina State University](https://www.ncsu.edu/) (NC State) to have my master's program. NC State is famous for the Rank #1 in the US of the major of textiles, which is set in [Wilson College of Textiles](https://textiles.ncsu.edu/) (WCoT). I joined WCoT's master program in textile engineering under supervision of Prof. [Thomas B.H. Schroeder](https://textiles.ncsu.edu/people/tschroe/), and of course I joined [Schroeder Research Group](https://schroeder-lab.org/). I am currently doing research on wearable energy harvester now.
